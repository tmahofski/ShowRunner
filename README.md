# 4H Show Runner App

This app will allow users (Participants & Show Staff) to execute a 4H horse show. 
This format will also work for any other 4H or youth show at most fairs.

A horse show runs with many events (called a class), some running simultaneously. 
The classes are scheduled in a specific order and happen one after the other in a "ring." 
At the start of the day, the 4Hers will register for the classes and pay a small fee.
Then as the show progresses, the 4Hers will enter their class. Each class is then judged, and placement is announced at the end.
